# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

Keep in mind this code is not meant to be used as a reference and don't follow any quality metrics.
The goal is to solve the puzzles as quick as possible (while learning Rust).

## Usage

To run a specific day (1-24) execute cargo with the `bin`ary flag:
`cargo run --bin day[n]` where `[n]` is the number of the day.
